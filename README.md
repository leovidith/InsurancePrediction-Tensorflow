# Insurance Charges Prediction

## Overview:
This project demonstrates a regression model built using TensorFlow to predict insurance charges based on features such as age, sex, BMI, and smoking status. The system processes the data, trains a predictive model, and evaluates its performance to provide insights into insurance pricing.

## Why Use Machine Learning for Insurance Charges Prediction?
Machine learning is ideal for predicting insurance charges because:
- It automates the prediction of insurance premiums based on individual characteristics.
- It adapts to various input features, allowing for personalized pricing.
- It optimizes risk assessment by identifying patterns in the data that traditional methods might miss.

## Agile Sprint Features:

### **Sprint 1: Data Preprocessing and Setup**
- Clean and preprocess the data:
  - Normalize numerical features (e.g., age, BMI).
  - One-hot encode categorical features (e.g., sex, smoker).
- **Deliverable**: Cleaned and preprocessed dataset ready for model training.

### **Sprint 2: Model Architecture Design**
- Design a neural network model with dropout layers for regularization.
- Compile the model with an appropriate loss function and optimizer.
- **Deliverable**: Initial model architecture designed and compiled.

### **Sprint 3: Model Training and Evaluation**
- Train the model with early stopping to prevent overfitting.
- Evaluate the model on test data to assess prediction accuracy.
- **Deliverable**: Trained model with evaluation metrics (e.g., MAE, MSE).

### **Sprint 4: Visualization and Performance Monitoring**
- Plot the training and validation loss over epochs to monitor model progress.
- Analyze the model's prediction results and provide insights into the relationships between input features and insurance charges.
- **Deliverable**: Loss plots and detailed analysis of model performance.

### **Sprint 5: Deployment and Documentation**
- Deploy the trained model for real-time predictions or batch processing.
- Provide documentation on:
  - How to train and use the model.
  - How to visualize performance metrics and loss.
- **Deliverable**: Deployed model with user-friendly documentation.
